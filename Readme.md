NetIntelli X
üöÄ Project Overview
NetIntelli X is a powerful Python-based desktop application designed to revolutionize network device configuration and management. It integrates robust network automation capabilities with advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) to streamline operations, reduce errors, and provide context-aware assistance to network engineers.
Leveraging Netmiko for secure SSH connectivity and popular Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google Gemini, OpenAI, and local Ollama models, this application allows users to generate and deploy vendor-speciÔ¨Åc CLI commands using natural language requests. It enhances eÔ¨Éciency by understanding the live running conÔ¨Åguration of devices, ensuring generated commands are accurate and contextually relevant.

‚ú® Key Features
Multi-Vendor Network Connectivity: Secure SSH connections to H3C, Cisco, Juniper, Arista, and other devices via Netmiko.
AI-Powered Command Generation: Translate natural language requests into precise, vendor-speciÔ¨Åc CLI commands using Gemini, OpenAI, or Ollama.
Context-Aware AI Assistance: AI considers device manufacturer, model, version, and the live running conÔ¨Åguration for highly accurate command suggestions.
Automated Device Discovery: Pre-checks upon connection automatically identify and populate device model and software version.
Live ConÔ¨Åguration Fetch: Fetch and display the current running conÔ¨Åguration from connected devices, providing critical context to the AI.
Direct Command Deployment: Push AI-generated commands directly to the connected device with a single click.
Connection ProÔ¨Åle Management: Save and load device connection details and AI context for quick access.
Interactive Terminal: Real-time display of device output and manual command input.
Flexible AI Backend: Choose between cloud-based LLMs (Gemini, OpenAI) or local models (Ollama).

Intuitive GUI: User-friendly interface built with Tkinter for ease of use.

‚öô Installation
To get started with NetIntelli X, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository (or download the Ô¨Åles)



Alternatively, you can download the directly into a single directory.

, and
Ô¨Åles

Python Environment
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using	:

Ollama Setup (Optional, for local LLMs)
If you plan to use Ollama for local AI models:

Download and Install Ollama: Follow the instructions on the oÔ¨Écial Ollama website: https://ollama.com/download

Download Models: Pull the desired models (e.g., For example:
Ensure the Ollama server is running on

.
) using the Ollama CLI.

üöÄ Usage
To run the application, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute:

ProÔ¨Åle Management: Use the ProÔ¨Åle  dropdown to load saved connection details.
You can	new proÔ¨Åles or Delete existing ones.

Device Details: Enter the

). This informs Netmiko and the AI about the correct syntax to use.

Connect/Disconnect: Click

API Key: Enter your API key for cloud-based providers (Gemini, OpenAI). This Ô¨Åeld will be disabled for Ollama and Simulation.

Ollama Model: If
is selected, this dropdown will populate with models

Your Request: Type your natural language request (e.g., "create a default gateway of 10.1.0.1 and dns server of 8.8.8.8 and trunk all ports from Gi1/0/1 - Gi1/0/24").
Use Web Search (Gemini): Check this box to enable web search for Gemini, potentially improving accuracy.

Fetch Running ConÔ¨Åg: Click this button (available when connected) to retrieve the live running conÔ¨Åguration from your device. This conÔ¨Åguration is then used by the AI as context for subsequent requests.
The fetched conÔ¨Åguration will be displayed in the text area below.
Status Bar:
Located at the bottom of the window, it provides real-time feedback on the application's operations and status.

üîß ConÔ¨Åguration

Connection proÔ¨Åles are stored in a	Ô¨Åle in the same directory as	.
This Ô¨Åle is automatically created and managed by the application. It stores sensitive information like passwords in plain text. Ensure this Ô¨Åle is secured appropriately on your local machine.

AI API Keys
API keys for Gemini and OpenAI are entered directly into the GUI. These are not persistently stored by the application beyond the current session for security reasons. You will need to re-enter them if you restart the application or switch providers.

‚ö† Troubleshooting
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'telnetlib' : This indicates you are likely running
Python 3.13 or newer, which removed telnetlib . Ensure your	version is up-to-
date ( pip install --upgrade netmiko ) or use a Python version older than 3.13.
Failed to connect to Ollama : Verify that the Ollama server is running on http://localhost:11434 and that you have downloaded the models you intend to use (e.g., ollama pull llama3 ). Check your Ô¨Årewall settings.

AI generates incorrect vendor commands: Ensure the
Ô¨Åeld in the

Connection panel is correctly Ô¨Ålled. The AI uses this crucial context to generate vendor- speciÔ¨Åc CLI. If the issue persists, try making your natural language request more explicit (e.g., "for an H3C switch, create...").
GUI is unresponsive: Long-running network operations can sometimes cause the GUI to freeze. This application uses a basic Tkinter loop. For very long operations, consider running them in a separate thread (advanced usage).
	AttributeError: '_tkinter.tkapp' object has no attribute 'update_status' : This indicates a missing update_status method or status bar initialization. Ensure you are using the latest app_gui.py provided, which includes the status bar implementation.
