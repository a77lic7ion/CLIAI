Intelligent Network Manager with AI
Assistant
ðŸš€ Project Overview
The Intelligent Network Manager with AI Assistant is a powerful Python-based desktop
application designed to revolutionize network device configuration and management. It
integrates robust network automation capabilities with advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI)
to streamline operations, reduce errors, and provide context-aware assistance to network
engineers.
Leveraging Netmiko for secure SSH connectivity and popular Large Language Models
(LLMs) like Google Gemini, OpenAI, and local Ollama models, this application allows users
to generate and deploy vendor-specific CLI commands using natural language requests. It
enhances efficiency by understanding the live running configuration of devices, ensuring
generated commands are accurate and contextually relevant.
